# Factorio-UnitLocationHotkeys

Mod for Factorio: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/UnitLocationHotkeys


Adds a panel for creating shortcuts to allow quickly centering your map on a specific entity or location. Useful for large factories where it takes a while to move between points of interest, keeping track of the location of something, or managing multiple spidertrons.

Click the button or use the associated hotkey to jump to a location. Possible to also automatically select a connected spidertron controller when the target is a spidertron. Also allows for following an entity, keeping your screen centered on it as it moves (with some issues due to API limitations, notably selection tools not working).
